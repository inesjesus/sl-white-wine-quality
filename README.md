# White Wine Quality Analysis

In this report, a ”White Wine Quality” dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushagni5/white-wine-quality) is analysed to determine if it is possible to predict the quality of white wine based on its physicochemical properties and, of these, which are the most influential.

We perform classification and multivariate analysis considering some models:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Penalised Logistic Regression with Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques
